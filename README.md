# AsciiChess
To play Chess run Game.java
To move pieces enter starting coordinates of piece and target position separated by "-" (coordinates start in bottom left corner at 1 1)
e.x. 12-14 This moves the first pawn from the left side two spaces up.
You win the game by capturing the opponents king (for now)

Still under development!!!
Might add a python version later(to play in Shell)
